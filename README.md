# Ghostty Discord Bot

The [Ghostty Discord][discord-invite] Bot, humorlessly named "Ghostty Bot."

It originally powered the invite system during Ghostty's private beta period,
successfully inviting ~5,000 people.
It now serves as the community's helper bot, making development discussion and
community moderation more efficient.

# Bot setup

## 1. Creating a Discord application
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal][discord-docs].
2. Click on the "New Application" button and pick a name for it.
3. Go to the "Bot" section, use "Reset Token" and save the new token.
4. In that same section, enable the "Server Members Intent" and "Message Content
   Intent".
5. Go to the "OAuth2" section, select the `bot` scope, and choose the
   permissions you want to grant your bot; Ghostty Bot currently relies the
   following (bitfield `1125900712192000`):
   * Manage Roles
   * Manage Webhooks
   * Send Messages
   * Manage Messages
   * Attach Files
   * Use External Apps
6. Use the generated URL at the bottom of the page to invite the bot to your
   server.


## 2. Getting a GitHub token

A GitHub token is necessary for the bot's Entity Mentions feature.

You can get one in two ways:
* On GitHub, go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens >
  Tokens (classic) > Generate new token, or use this link:
  [Generate new token][gh-new-token]. As the bot only accesses public
  repositories, it doesn't require any scopes.
* If you have the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, run `gh auth token`.


## 3. Preparing a Discord server

The following channels will be necessary:
* `#help`: a forum channel
* `#media`: a text channel
* `#showcase`: a text channel

The following roles will be necessary (both requiring the Manage Messages
permission):
* `mod`
* `helper`

## 4. Preparing the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on `.env.example`.
Below are explanations for each variable:
* channel/role IDs from [step 3](#3-preparing-a-discord-server):
  * `BOT_HELP_CHANNEL_ID`
  * `BOT_MEDIA_CHANNEL_ID`
  * `BOT_SHOWCASE_CHANNEL_ID`
  * `BOT_MOD_ROLE_ID`
  * `BOT_HELPER_ROLE_ID`
* `BOT_TOKEN`: the Discord bot token from
  [step 1](#1-creating-a-discord-application).
* `GITHUB_ORG`: the GitHub organization name.
* `GITHUB_REPOS`: a comma-separated list of `prefix:repo_name` pairs used for
  entity mention prefixes. The `main`/`bot`/`web` prefixes aren't exactly fixed,
  but some of the bot logic assumes these names (e.g. defaulting to `main`).
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: the GitHub token from [step 2](#2-getting-a-github-token).
* `SENTRY_DSN`: the Sentry DSN (optional).


## 5. Running the bot

> [!note]
> The Nix environment is the only supported development environment. You can
> develop this without Nix, of course, but I'm not going to help you figure it
> out.

### Nix

Run the bot with:
```console
$ python -m app
...
```

After you've made your changes, run the linter and formatter:
```console
$ ruff check
$ ruff format
```


### Non-Nix

This bot runs on Python 3.11+ and is managed with [Poetry]. To get started:
1. Install Poetry (e.g. via [uv] or [pipx]).
2. Install the project and run the bot:
   ```console
   $ poetry install
   ```
3. Run the bot:
   ```console
   $ poetry run python -m app
   ...
   ```
4. After you've made your changes, run the linter and formatter:
   ```console
   $ poetry run ruff check
   $ poetry run ruff format
   ```


# Project structure

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a82433e-9f20-4189-a409-03cbc108a44c" alt="Project structure graph">

* `components/` is a place for all dedicated features, such as message filters
  or entity mentions. Most new features should become modules belonging to this
  package.
* `config.py` handles reading and parsing the environment variables and the
  local `.env` file. Although a standalone module, it's typically accessed
  through a `setup.py` re-export for brevity:
  ```diff
  -from app import config
  -from app.setup import bot
  +from app.setup import bot, config
  ```
* `core.py` loads the `components` package and houses the code for handling the
  most standard bot events (e.g. `on_ready`, `on_message`, `on_error`).
* `setup.py` creates the Discord and GitHub clients.
* `utils.py` contains utility functions not exactly tied to a specific feature.
* `__main__.py` initializes Sentry (optional) and starts the bot.


# Features

## `/docs`

A command for linking Ghostty documentation with autocomplete and an optional
message option:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cc0f7f0-8145-4dca-b7e6-5db18d939427" alt="/docs command autocomplete" height="250px">

</p>

## Entity mentions

Automatic links to Ghostty's GitHub issues/PRs/discussions ("entities") when a
message contains GitHub-like mentions (`#1234`). It reacts to message edits and
deletions for 24 hours, while also providing a "üóëÔ∏è Delete" button for 30 seconds
in case of false positives. Mentioning entities in other repos is also supported
with prefixes:
* `web` for [ghostty-org/website][website-repo], e.g. `web#78`
* `bot` for [ghostty-org/discord-bot][bot-repo], e.g. `bot#98`
* `main` for [ghostty-org/ghostty][main-repo] (default), e.g. `main#2137` or
  just `#2137`

The bot also keeps a TTL-like cache to avoid looking up the same entity multiple
times (with data being refetched 30 minutes since last use), making the bot more
responsive (the example below can take ~3s on the first lookup and ~50¬µs on
subsequent lookups).

## Message filters

This feature takes care of keeping the `#showcase` and `#media` channels clean.
The bot will delete any message:
* without an attachment in `#showcase`
* without a link in `#media`

It will also DM users about the deletion and provide an explanation to make it
less confusing:

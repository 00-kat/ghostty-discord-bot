Please read the README and the README_TESTERS.md file. Details on what to expect,
how to download/configure Ghostty, and a small FAQ are all present. You're an early
tester so I'm going to hold you to a higher bar and expect you'll read! Thanks. ü•∞

I also just want to remind you that Ghostty is still early beta software, and
the goal of you joining is so that you can report what is lacking and help us
make Ghostty great for you (and maybe even contribute, if you want!). Most of us
in the community are able to use Ghostty all day every day for our full time jobs
and its working great, but every new person brings a new perspective and new workflow
and small "obvious" issues are common. Please report it and we'll make it better.

That being said, feel free to talk about Ghostty publicly. You're welcome to share
screenshots, stream with it, whatever. Just please do not share the source code yet.

You should have received an invite from GitHub with a link to the repo.
